# Adding Recipes to the Food-to-Fork Repository

1. Log into GitHub
2. On https://github.com/tiago-rorke/food-to-fork/, create your own copy the repository by clicking on `fork` (to the right of the repository title). Keep the default options and select `Create fork`
4. On your new copy of the repository, select `Add file` (next to the the green `Code` button).
5. In the `Name your file...` box, first create a new folder by typing your recipe name followed by a forward slash `/` followed by your recipe name with the markdown extension `.md`, eg:  
`my_new_recipe/my_new_recipe.md`
6. Using the markdown format, fill in your recipe. You can add an image to the recipe either by embedding an image found online, or by uploading your own image to the repository.  To upload your own image, first embed your image using the link `![](your_image_name.jpg)` and then upload the image after you have saved your recipe markdown file to a new commit.
When using images that are not yours, make sure these have a license that allows them to be used, and include any necessary credits.
7. Once your additions to the repository are finished, create a pull request to add these to the upstream repository, by selecting `Contribute` and `Open pull request`.  Briefly describe your addition to the respository, and any comments you would like to add, and select `Create pull request`
8. Once the pull request has been merged, your recipe will be visible in the original `food-to-fork` repository!
