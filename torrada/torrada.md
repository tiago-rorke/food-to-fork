Torrada or "big toast" is common in Portuguese cafes.  Usually it is two lightly toasted thick slices of white bread, liberally coated with butter and each sliced into three fingers.

In Spain, on the other hand, toast is usually taken with olive oil (and sometimes a little tomato) instead of butter.
